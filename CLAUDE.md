# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Purpose

This is a collection of markdown cheatsheets for quick reference. Each file is a standalone reference document covering a specific topic.

## Structure

- Each cheatsheet is a single markdown file in the root directory
- Use tables for shortcut/command references
- Organize content with clear section headers

## Adding New Cheatsheets

Follow the existing format in `terminal-shortcuts.md`:
- Title as H1
- Brief description after title
- Grouped sections with H2/H3 headers
- Tables with Shortcut/Command and Action columns
- Notes section at end for caveats or platform differences
